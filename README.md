**MacOS users will need to run the included `codesign.sh` file in order to sign and run the AGI locally.**

## Usage

AgenticAGI is a command-line tool that can be customized to fit your needs. Here’s a basic example of how to get started:

### Interactive Mode 💬

Launch AgenticAGI in interactive mode where it awaits your commands:

```bash
agi --interactive true --cooldown 3 --apikey YOUR_API_KEY --model llama-3.1-70b-versatile
```

### Fully Autonomous Mode 🤖⚙️

Run a task autonomously, such as retrieving a WiFi password, with no human-in-the-middle:

```bash
agi --cooldown 3 --apikey YOUR_API_KEY --model llama-3.1-70b-versatile --task "Retrieve WiFi password for 'TheNet'"
```

### Available Flags 🏁

- `--apiendpoint` : Completions URL endpoint (DEFAULT = `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions`).
- `--apikey` : LLM API key.
- `--confidence` : (Confidence/Truthfulness/Satisfaction/Validity) score (0-100%) of the final answer, provided in JSON format (DEFAULT = True).
- `--contextlimit` : Maximum number of memories used to make decisions (DEFAULT = 50).
- `--cooldown` : Duration in seconds between LLM requests (DEFAULT = 10).
- `--fao` : Final Answer Only. If set to true, see `--schema` flag for structured data output.
- `--hitm` : Human-in-the-middle allows the AGI to ask the user for information during task completion (DEFAULT = True).
- `--inputprice` : Set the INPUT price of tokens per million. See `--showprice` flag.
- `--interactive` : Start Agentic AGI in interactive mode. Each task run is a new session (DEFAULT = False).
- `--maxcorrections` : Sets the self-correction limit (DEFAULT = 3).
- `--model` : LLM model to use.
- `--newlines` : Outputs newlines as \n (DEFAULT = False).
- `--outputprice` : Set the OUTPUT price of tokens per million. See `--showprice` flag.
- `--pytimeout` : Python script timeout period (in seconds) before Python is terminated and control is returned to the AGI (DEFAULT = 60 sec).
- `--schema` : A defined custom tag (`<search>{query}</search>`) or JSON structure (`{ "ans": {{final_response}} }`) for the 'final answer'/response. See `--fao` flag.
- `--selfcorrect` : Allow the model to self-correct when confidence/truthfulness < 92%, satisfaction < 85%, or inaccurate/invalid perception > 3% (DEFAULT = False). When enabled, confidence will auto-enable. See `--maxcorrections` flag.
- `--showprice` : Show token usage and input/output pricing per task completion. See `--inputprice` and `--outputprice` flags (DEFAULT = False).
- `--steplimit` : The maximum number of steps the AGI can perform before answering or giving up (DEFAULT = 25).
- `--task` : The task to be solved or completed.
- `--urlencode` : Encodes output using URL encoding (DEFAULT = False).

**Note**: By default, Groq is the default LLM service if an `--apiendpoint` is not specified.
